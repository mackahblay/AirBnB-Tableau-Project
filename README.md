Title: "Airbnb Insights: Analyzing Price Trends and Listings"

Description:
Welcome to my Airbnb project where I delve into the world of Airbnb listings, prices, and reviews using data from three CSV datasets - Airbnb calendar, listings, and reviews. This project aims to provide valuable insights for both hosts and guests alike, giving a comprehensive view of pricing trends, popular zip codes, and the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms.

### Overview
The project begins with a compiled workbook in XLSX format, integrating the three CSV datasets. This workbook was then uploaded to Tableau Public, where I created five interactive dashboards, each presenting distinct perspectives on Airbnb data.

### Dashboards:
1. **Price Trends Over Time:**
   The first dashboard features a line graph depicting the average price per week throughout the year. The x-axis represents the weeks of the year, while the y-axis displays the average price. This visualization provides an insight into how pricing fluctuates over different periods, helping both hosts and guests plan accordingly.

2. **Price Distribution by Zip Code:**
   The second dashboard takes a geographical approach, showcasing a map of zip codes with corresponding average prices. This interactive map allows clients to visually identify areas with varying price ranges, aiding in location-based decision-making.

3. **Average Price per Bedroom:**
   Moving on to the third dashboard, I present a bar graph illustrating the average price per bedroom. Here, the y-axis represents the average price, while the x-axis displays the number of bedrooms. This graph provides an understanding of how pricing scales with the number of bedrooms, assisting guests in finding suitable accommodations.

4. **Price Variation Across Zip Codes (Bar Graph):**
   The fourth visualization revisits price variations by zip code, this time using a bar graph format. This graph provides a quick comparison of average prices across different zip codes, aiding in identifying areas that fit specific budget requirements.

5. **Distribution of Listings by Bedroom Number:**
   The final dashboard presents a table detailing the distribution of Airbnb listings by the number of bedrooms. The left column lists the number of bedrooms (ranging from 1 to 6), while the right column shows the corresponding number of Airbnb listings. This table offers a straightforward overview of the availability of different bedroom configurations, helping guests in their search for the ideal accommodation.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this Airbnb project offers a comprehensive exploration of pricing trends, popular zip codes, and the distribution of listings based on bedroom numbers. Whether you're a host looking to optimize pricing strategies or a guest searching for the perfect stay, these visualizations provide valuable insights to enhance your Airbnb experience. Explore the dashboards to uncover valuable information and make informed decisions for your next Airbnb adventure!
